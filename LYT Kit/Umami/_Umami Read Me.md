This folder is called "Umami" because of its mysteriousness. Apparently umami is one of the five basic tastes. There are: Sweetness, Sourness, Saltiness, Bitterness, and that oddball Umami.

Umami is hard to describe but you know when it's there. The same is true of this folder's contents. It's a mixture of insights and ideas, concepts and connections, all mingling together to create that mysterious full mouthfeel that magnificently completes any meal for the mind.

### Knowledge Umami can encourage wise behavior
Information is everywhere. It is in a book, it's in a cozy nook, it's absolutely everywhere we look. 

Information is all around us. 

Once we have a relationship with any bit of information—consciously or subconsciously—that information becomes knowledge.

Said another way: Information that crosses our attentional filter becomes knowledge.

With enough knowledge, experience, and "connecting-the-dots" that comes from living; we form patterns of insights, heuristics, helpful models of the world. The better we get, the more complex patterns we are able to chunk into bite size bits that we can act upon. 

Pattern recognition alone doesn’t make us wise, but it gets us closer to wisdom. It opens the door to acting with more of that cumulative **umami** we might call wisdom.

All from making sense—over time—of countless bits of information.
