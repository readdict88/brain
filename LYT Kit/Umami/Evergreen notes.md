# Evergreen notes
Most people take "just-in-time" notes. They take them for a specific short-term purpose—like a test or a project. When the milestone concludes, the notes lose their value. That's "Churn and Burn".

Evergreen note-*making* is diametrically opposed to this type of short-term note-*taking*. Instead of losing value over time, evergreen notes are able to grow in value and evolve. That's "Know and Grow".

### Common properties of evergreen notes
While evergreen notes are still just regular notes, they have some very unique properties. 

- *Clear, Concise, & Distinct (Atomic)*[^1] - The title for evergreen notes should be a clear title or statement. Formulating this one-liner clarifies and sharpens your thinking. And the hidden beauty is that this process naturally enforces an atomic note size—meaning "one note = one idea".
- I am not dogmatic about this and usually just try to be an intuitive Goldilocks note-maker: Not too short, not too long...Long enough to explain the concept; but short enough to not overstay my welcome.

- *Own Words & Unique Perspective* - Writing in your own words is yet another constraint that forces you to actually think about what you're trying to say. If your goals are to learn and grow your own thoughts over time, then your evergreen notes should be in your own words.
- *Linked* - Your evergreen notes should have links to other notes. This should happens effortlessly if you've made atomic notes, with concise statements, in your own words. (As you already know, the [[Benefits of Linked Thinking]] are next level.)
- *Non-static* - The modular, linkable nature of evergreen notes allows them to grow and evolve over time as you encounter anything that might relate to the note. In this way, your evergreen notes are like living entities—gaining in insights and complexity as time passes.
