# Concepts MOC
*A concept is a pattern, truth, or mechanism recognized and given a name.*
Just like the primordial goop that collided together billions of years ago to spark life on earth, so do these conceptual collisions spark exciting and diverse ideas.

## Daily reminders of powerful concepts
Why not string out these ideas into paragraphs? What a way to unearth hidden connections!

Starting some days, I'll consider how to apply three *strategic* mental models: [[OODA Loop]], [[Levels of Magnification]], and [[Refraction Thinking]].

For my work as an editor/AE in TV, I know to improve my craft means the steady application of getting [[Reps]], creating the conditions for [[Flow]], which involves environmental  [[Forcing Function|Forcing Functions]], and considering when I can multitask [[Shadow Clone]]. 


[[Natural Selection]] is one of the mega-concepts. It helps me decipher the signal from the noise through the mechanism of considering the [[Lindy Effect]], along with [[Hormesis]] and [[Antifragility]]—and also more broadly [[Cause and Effect]].

This reminds me of [[Concept Expansion]].

In times of stress it helps me to broaden my perspective and consider concepts like: [[Ying and Yang]], [[Synthesis]], [[Seasons]].

Dealing with folks in the entertainment industry—and just throughout life really—there are plenty of instances to consider ways to handle ego and aggression. The most fascinating is [[No-Face]] from Spirited Away, which leads to [[The Id]]. [[Aikido deflects and dissipates an attacker's energy]] is good to remember.

For more avenues to re-expanding my narrowed perspectve, try to revisit the [[Rubik's Cube]], or pull from [[Munger's Mental Models]].
