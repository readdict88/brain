### (In Progress) Release notes for LYT v5 - 2021-03
- 226 Notes
- Refined Home note
- Thinking about taking away the numbers on my top ten MOCs because some people get really caught up thinking they have to number everything. Don't. Number. Everything.
- Took away the Calendar MOC because: I didn't use it, other people got the wrong ideas about it, and frankly, the "Calendar" plugin is wonderful.
- Incorporated more "Art of Link Curation", where the creator responsibly guides the reader with fewer, more deliberately curated links to click on. It's basically attempting to use "Choose Your Own Adventure" concepts.
- Shifted Back Matter to Front Matter, and hid a lot of the Front Matter to keep control over the story being told. (Note: YAML functionality isn't quite there yet, but ask me again in a few months!)
- For those wondering, this theme that I love so dearly is called the [[Cybertron Theme]].
- Hidden easter eggs in the forest
