# Finances MOC
I prefer to keep personal finances and health-related info in a separate vault for privacy purposes, but you don't have to. There are some areas of finance (like managing taxes) that are better with computer folders, PDFs, and spreadsheets; but there are other areas of finances that do work well within a link-based library of notes. Here are some examples for you...
