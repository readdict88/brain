- 5 Western philosopher: Kierkegaard, Camus, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Sartre

#### 5 Features of Crisis
1. Reveal that something normal/common sense to be unnormal, relative, could be wrong/different (why this not that?) => WE'RE MORE FREE THAN WE THOUGHT
2. Inducing anxiety, spotlight bias when actually nobody cares, just be responsible to ourselves
3. More aware of death and value of time
4. Many choices, but no adequate information/reason to confirm the choice 
5. Man always made with anxiety, always choose in blind, fundamental features, FACE IT, IT'S NORMAL, REGRET/DISAPPOINTMENT ALWAYS HAPPEN, JUST CHOOSE IT, LIVE BY IT!

# [ESSENTIALISM VS EXISTENTIALISM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaDvRdLMkHs)
WHAT GIVES LIFE MEANING? => ESSENTIALISM VS EXISTENTIALISM (dialectic)
Plato and Aristotle, everything has essence, core/essential properties. Being a good man is adhere to your essence

Nietzsche introduce Nihilism
Sartre ask what if we exist first => Existence precede essence, you're exist then you determine what you're
No teleology, no purpose/value in the end. 
Actually nothing really important anymore => welcome to absurdity (seeking answer in answerless world) NO ABSOLUTE, NO RULE
SARTRE: BUT, IT'S NOT MEANINGLESS AT ALL!
**You're burdened by freedom, abundance of choice, with no guidance**
Any Authority is fake, bullshit, they're also uncertain, no answer
SO HOW? LIVE AUTHENTICALLY, CHOOSE YOUR OWN PATH, GIVE MEANING
Any choices, just choose one, that's your true choice, authentic choice
