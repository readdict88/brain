## New Framework for the study of Islamic Philosophy
bermula dari ISTAC, nanya Acikgencnc, origin science, is western of philosophy the mother of science? Responded, what do you mean Islam? Religion.. No it's a worldview, and explained in a semester.
Philosophy, it is the base of truth, and it is similar to Islam as philosophy.
is there of philosophy in Islam? some says, it is haram, foreign, not origin, it's from Greek. 
Philosophy exists in Islamic tradition. 
Philosophy here is worldview of Islam as the base of science. Many scholars describe Islamic Philosophy (IP): 
1. Islamic philosophy: revival of Greek philosophy by Muslim and Arab
2. Kalam is not from islamic tradition
3. Kalam is non quranic argument
4. Kalam made from Greek Syriac text

Said that learning IP start from al-Kindi, but it could be criticized. IP emerged from Hellenic Greek tradition. No origins of philosophy in Islam. It's said come from Christianity. But, in Kalam and IP you'll never find Christian teaching in them.
>Does that mean no IP before al-Kindi?

Any foreign concept will be modified, reformed, and criticized. They say, Greek is not the origin of West Philosophy. Greek is left behind and not influential. So, neither are true.
Quran is the source of Islamic Philosophy.
Assimilated is not originated. Both are different.
