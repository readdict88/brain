PHOTOREALISTIC MODPACK 1.1 byKarimus

IMPORTANT NOTE: Due to many requests from my viewers, unfortunately, I had to completely redo the archive, as it turned out that NexusMod prohibits re-uploading mods to other platforms. Therefore, to resolve this issue, I will include links to all the necessary mods from this site in this document. Just copy the links I left below and paste them into any of your browsers!

As you might have already guessed, the installation method for mods in Cyberpunk remains the same. All mods for this game are installed in the way I demonstrated in this video. You can always search for other mods yourself and install them in your game!

If you want your game to look as beautiful as possible, make sure to set all the game settings to ultra, including ray tracing. Without ray tracing, your game won’t look as stunning as it does in those popular YouTube videos. I hope your graphics cards can handle it. Good luck!

If you experience a ghosting effect after enabling FSR3 mod, unfortunately, as far as I know, there is no fix for it. This is a bug with FSR3 mod, as it wasn't originally designed for graphics cards below the 40 series.

Also, if you want to install Reshade to enhance your graphics, keep in mind that it doesn’t work with FSR3 mod. To install Reshade, you don’t need to install FSR3, as they are not compatible!

Also, the developers have now added official support for FSR3 in the game. If you prefer, you don't need to install the FSR3 mod. However, the FSR3 mod created by a community modder works better than the official version from the developers. The choice is yours!

Here is the main mod list:

Note for MAIN MODS FOLDER: As I later found out, thanks to the same viewers, I learned that Cyberpunk only uses one LUT mod and can't handle multiple LUT or graphical mods at the same time. Because of this, I decided to provide the LUT graphical mods separately, allowing you to manually choose the one you prefer. I will include links to the best LUT graphical mods, and you can choose the one you like. Remember, you can only choose one! The installation method is the same as shown in the video—just drag everything into the game folder.
