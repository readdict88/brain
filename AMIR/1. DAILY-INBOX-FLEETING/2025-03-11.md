# Neglected 
as if it is my ordinary treats, I just neglect the endless blaming with long silence with no final conclusion. It’s just a complete waste to use logics and reasoning in an emotional long debate. I knew there are things to consider together, the circumstances are just inappropriate. Seeing this pattern happens over and over, I think it must be brought to the end.  Words to consider in the next following days:
1. What is the top priority of the day? Consider it daily
2. Do your menial daily chores → sales, home, godhood
3. Check the neglected to do list from previous days
