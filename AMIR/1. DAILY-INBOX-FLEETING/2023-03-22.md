# Addicted to Po_n, UGH..
I’ve very bad addiction. I knew it’s bad, but still.. even after marriage, it still lit heat! Not so bad as before, but, you got the point,..
I knew it break my precious brain; as did other addiction, similar to cannabis and marijuana. I knew it would grow bad association, my penis won’t be turned on except triggered with pixels and strange beauty faces. I knew how to overcome it, that is to alternate with better habits - I have a lot! - and socialize more with spending quality time with people.
It is a choice, but, anyways, I can’t resist temptation, primarily when I’m alone and bored. I knew I could overcome it with exercising, delivering pain to my body and break my lazy muscle, but mostly I can’t make it.
I knew it could worsen my disease, problematic urethra. Or worse, can’t 
satisfy my beautiful precious wife, Farah. I feel very bad for her.. 

## It’s the matter of emotion and little choice
I chose to be bored, I chose to be alone, and I chose to be addicted. Is that so…?
I should deliberately take my time for rest, exercise, do what matters, leave mindless scrolling on my screens, both laptop and phone, and value my time better.
I think that’s my confession for now. May Allah accept my repentance.
